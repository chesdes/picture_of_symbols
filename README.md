#picture of symbols

my code replaces a pixel with a character depending on the "brightness" of the pixel

in the fonts folder, the fonts that im used personally, you can add your own there, the main thing is to change it in the code in the settings section

to pass your image through the program, add it to the imgs folder, the result will appear after a while in the results folder

to get the best results, change the settings in the code to suit you

my first repository :3 Good luck!
